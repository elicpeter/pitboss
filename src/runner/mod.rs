//! Orchestration loop and event channel.
//!
//! The runner owns the per-phase state machine. It snapshots the planning
//! artifacts, dispatches the implementer agent, validates the agent's output,
//! runs the project tests, and lands a per-phase commit. Every observable
//! transition is broadcast on a [`tokio::sync::broadcast`] channel so the CLI
//! logger and the (later) TUI can subscribe without changing the runner.
//!
//! Phase 12 wired the implementer-only flow: agent → validate → tests → commit.
//! Phase 13 layers a bounded fixer loop on top: when the project tests fail,
//! the runner dispatches the fixer agent up to
//! [`crate::config::RetryBudgets::fixer_max_attempts`] times, re-running tests
//! after each attempt, before halting. Phase 14 inserts the auditor pass
//! between the (passing) test run and the per-phase commit: when
//! [`crate::config::AuditConfig::enabled`] is on the runner stages the
//! implementer's diff, hands it to the auditor agent, re-validates the
//! planning artifacts, and re-runs the tests before letting the commit land.
