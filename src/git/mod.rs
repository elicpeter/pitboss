//! Git integration via a trait + shell-out implementation.
//!
//! The runner uses [`Git`] for every git operation it performs: checking the
//! working tree, creating and switching branches, staging the per-phase set of
//! changes, committing, and reading diff stats. Two implementations ship:
//!
//! - [`ShellGit`] shells out to the local `git` CLI. Production default.
//! - [`MockGit`] is an in-memory stub used by runner tests; it records every
//!   call and lets tests assert that the runner is passing the right exclusion
//!   set on `stage_changes`.
//!
//! The trait surface is intentionally narrow: pitboss never resolves merges,
//! talks to remotes, or rewrites history — it only lands per-phase commits
//! onto a fresh per-run branch. Adding scope here later means adding methods,
//! never reshaping the existing ones.
