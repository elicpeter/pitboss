//! Clap command definitions and dispatch.
//!
//! `init` is implemented (phase 5); `play` (phase 12), `plan` (phase 15), and
//! the lifecycle trio `status` / `rebuy` / `fold` (phase 17) round out the
//! current surface. Later phases plug into the same dispatch table.
//!
//! The verbs follow the casino theme baked into the binary name: a `play`
//! executes one phased plan to completion (one hand), `rebuy` picks the run
//! back up after a halt or fold (buying back into the table), and `fold`
//! marks the run aborted (this hand is over). For backwards compatibility
//! every renamed subcommand keeps its original name as a clap alias, so
//! `pitboss run`, `pitboss resume`, and `pitboss abort` continue to work.
