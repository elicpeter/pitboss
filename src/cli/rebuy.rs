//! `pitboss rebuy` — buy back into a halted run from `.pitboss/play/state.json`.
//!
//! Rebuy reuses the runner driver from [`crate::cli::play::execute`] with
//! [`StartMode::Resume`], so the only behavioral delta from `pitboss play`
//! is that a missing or empty `state.json` is an error: there is nothing to
//! rebuy into. The per-run branch is checked out, [`crate::runner::Runner`]
//! is constructed against the loaded plan / deferred / state, and execution
//! continues from `plan.current_phase`, which the runner advanced to the
//! next phase the last time it persisted state.
//!
//! `pitboss resume` is kept as a clap alias of `pitboss rebuy` so existing
//! scripts and muscle memory continue to work.
