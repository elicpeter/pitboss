//! `pitboss fold` — mark the active run folded (this hand is over),
//! optionally restoring the pre-run branch.
//!
//! Sets `state.aborted = true` (the on-disk field name predates the casino
//! rename and stays for backwards compat with existing state files) so
//! subsequent `pitboss play` and `pitboss rebuy` invocations refuse the
//! workspace. The state file is preserved as a breadcrumb (run id, branch,
//! attempts, token usage), clearing it is left to the user since deleting
//! state is irreversible. With `--checkout-original`, after the state update
//! the original branch recorded by `pitboss play` (when known) is checked
//! out via the shell git integration.
//!
//! `pitboss abort` is kept as a clap alias of `pitboss fold` so existing
//! scripts and muscle memory keep working.
