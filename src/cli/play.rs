//! `pitboss play` — execute the plan against the configured agent.
//!
//! Loads the workspace's `.pitboss/config.toml`, `.pitboss/play/plan.md`,
//! `.pitboss/play/deferred.md`, and `.pitboss/play/state.json`; ensures a
//! per-run branch exists; spawns a [`tokio::sync::broadcast`] subscriber that
//! streams [`runner::Event`]s to stderr; then drives the runner until the plan
//! completes or a phase halts.
//!
//! On a fresh run (state file is `null` or missing) this command derives a new
//! `run_id` and per-run branch from the current UTC timestamp, captures the
//! current branch as `original_branch` for `pitboss fold --checkout-original`,
//! and creates the branch in git. On a continuation (state present) the
//! existing branch is checked out instead. Phase 17's `pitboss rebuy` reuses
//! [`execute`] with [`StartMode::Resume`] to require an existing state file.
//!
//! Folded runs (`state.aborted == true`) are refused, the user must clear
//! `.pitboss/play/state.json` to start a new run.
//!
//! `pitboss run` is kept as a clap alias of `pitboss play`, so existing
//! scripts and muscle memory continue to work unchanged.
