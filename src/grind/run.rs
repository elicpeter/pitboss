//! Grind orchestrator: pick a prompt, dispatch the agent, capture the
//! summary, commit, repeat — sequentially or across parallel worktrees.
//!
//! [`GrindRunner`] wires together the artifacts assembled in phases 01-10:
//! discovered prompts, a [`GrindPlan`], a [`Scheduler`], and an open
//! [`RunDir`]. One [`GrindRunner::run`] call drives the loop until the
//! scheduler is exhausted, the run is drained (one Ctrl-C), or the run is
//! aborted (second Ctrl-C, or any other [`CancellationToken::cancel`]).
//!
//! Phase 11 lifts the runner from "one session at a time" to a real
//! concurrency gate. Each prompt declares whether it is `parallel_safe`; the
//! plan declares its `max_parallel` ceiling. A `tokio::sync::Semaphore` of
//! `max_parallel` permits guards dispatch:
//!
//! - A `parallel_safe: true` prompt grabs one permit, runs in its own
//!   [`SessionWorktree`] off `<run-root>/worktrees/session-NNNN/`, and
//!   fast-forwards the run branch to its session tip on completion.
//! - A `parallel_safe: false` prompt grabs *all* `max_parallel` permits,
//!   effectively serializing it against any in-flight parallel sessions.
//!   It runs in the main workspace exactly the way phase 07 wired it up.
//!
//! The runner is intentionally agnostic to the surface that signals a stop:
//! it takes a [`GrindShutdown`] handle that carries an
//! [`AtomicBool`] drain flag and a
//! [`CancellationToken`] abort token. The CLI binds those to live `Ctrl-C`
//! events; the integration tests flip them by hand.
